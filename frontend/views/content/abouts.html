            </div>
			<p class="text-justify">A young and enterprising student bustling with ideas which were often tagged as outrageous and ahead of his times, Sandeep knew it during his MBA days that he was smitten by the entrepreneurial bug.  Poised with an evangelist’s zeal to pursue his passion, he successfully launched and ran multiple businesses ranging from online contracting and sub-contracting of local service providers, online biding portals and recruiting. These were his building blocks and he learnt the ropes of running a business with a fair share of success and failure with much aplomb.  His next adventure was with his confidant and friend Monojit - a claims adjustment & mortgage processing unit which they ran with considerable success. It is during these days that, after a lot of brainstorming, both Sandeep and Monojit stumbled upon this idea of working around land survey and signage drafting pandering to the surveyors & engineers in the US. This idea blossomed into what everyone knows as G-Source today which is a 50 people company and growing stronger by the day.  Already working with clients across 20 states in the US, Sandeep is spearheading G-Source in the next phase into GIS, BIM & creating customized applications for our clients in the US and all around the world.</p>
