                           The architectural CAD system that creates the visual model of the edifice has the related databases needed by the other specialists involved, empowering the architects in charge of the building’s creation. Most importantly, CAD creates a bridge between the architect and the client by giving the clients the power to participate in the design process. The clients do not need a lot of architectural knowledge to fully understand the CAD-rendered models that

                           Structures, designs and workflows are becoming more complex, while clients demand more for their money. 3D modeling solutions give you and your company the edge over 2D counterparts. 3D modeling solutions offer much better insights and perspective when creating designs. They give you the ability to test the stress factors and tolerances of a building or product prior to the building phase, saving time, money and potentially disastrous consequences. A 3D model also lets you visualize the results before an inch of construction begins, allowing you to correct issues before it’s too late. 3D CAD software goes way beyond design- with support for advanced analysis tools they simulate the flow of fluid to measuring vibrations in key structural components. These are critical to identifying design flaws and pinpointing serious build problems before a disaster occurs. You can also take advantage of 3D printing technologies, which use 3D CAD files to come up with prototypes and models which directly bring down prototyping costs. Even small firms can now leverage 3D printing these days and take part in the action and print on-demand in response to customer needs.

							3D offers you some key advantages over 2D. In 2D CAD, a lot of time and energy is spent ensuring that your plan, section and elevation agree. In 3D, architects and engineers can swiftly extract that 2D information from a 3D model, leaving more time to focus on the design process. With 3D CAD software, every component of a structure can also be isolated, analyzed, tested, approved or changed without accidentally altering other design components.3D modeling efficiency can help you do more with less designing man power and you can focus those resources elsewhere. 
						</li>
						<li>
							While your 2D designs can do a lot, nothing compares to giving clients and prospects a virtual tour of their building. 3D modeling shows clients an interactive visual representation of the final product, before you even need to think about a physical prototype or model. Firms in possession with a 3D printer can go one step further and create a physical representation of their designs before meeting with clients much better prices than factory moulding fees.
						</li>
						<li>
							3D designers also gain a significant market advantage by offering clients more customized building designs, since individual design elements can be changed at the move of a click. Since these systems are built for customization, those changes don’t cost much aside from mouse clicks—increasing your profit margins.
