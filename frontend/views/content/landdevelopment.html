                            Real estate developers, counties and city planners alike need a system in place where they can track the developments on ground over time. For builders and developers, planning of future constructions on the vast acres of land they possess needs a detailed reporting of the terrain and vicinity from time to time.  Counties need precise updates of the cadastral maps falling in the boundary of the county to update and revise property taxes.  Similarly, city planners and all utility providers need a good idea of the ground reality to make decisions of severe implications. G-Source, with its sound understanding of surveying and mapping, coupled with its expertise in civil and engineering, provides you tailor made solutions for all these requirements.
